# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-17)

- `agent-access-review demo` reviews the bundled examples right after `pip install`; no clone needed.
- Committed [`sample-output/`](sample-output) so the report can be read without running anything; CI checks it stays current.
- Reproducible output: set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for byte-identical evidence and OSCAL (deterministic OSCAL UUIDs, LF line endings on every OS).
- Sources inside a scanned folder are recorded relative to it, so evidence hashes don't depend on the install path.
- OpenSSF Scorecard workflow, contributing guide and issue forms.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-16)

First release: 12 access-review checks for AI agents and MCP servers, reviewer packet, decision sheet, hashed evidence and OSCAL output.
